            <p>This webpage shares with the readers the different pets that I have had. Growing up, I have had 
             dogs, small turtles, and a chicken.  As an adult, I have had my own dog and two cats.  Here is a 
            bit about my pets.</p>

             <p class="petDesc">As a kid, we got a family dog, a dachshund mix, as a puppy.  Her name was Cleo. I do not remember
             Cleo as a puppy, but her mother was my cousin&#39;s dog Cindy.   </p>

            <h2>Chico</h2>
            <img src=".\images\Chico3cropped.jpg" alt="Chico" height="400" width="400"></image>
            <p class="petDesc">The second dog that we had was Chico.  Chico and his brother were dumped out of a car in the 
            neighborhood as young dogs.  Our neighbor across the street saw the dogs being dumped and took them in.
            He and his wife kept the white dog and offered my mom the black dog.  When I came home from school one day,
            there was a furry, black dog in the house!  For quite awhile, the neighbors called their dog Boy, so 
            we decided to name ours the Spanish equivalent, Chico.  (They eventually gave Boy the name of Bandit instead.)
            Chico was a small, cool mutt.  He wagged his tail up-and-down instead of side-to-side.  He was a great dog
             to have through childhood. </p>

            <section>
            <a name=turtles></a>   
            <h2>Lucky and Buddy</h2>
            <img src=".\images\babyRedSliderTurtlesCropped.jpg" alt="turtles" height="350" width="468"></image>
            <p class="petDesc">During grade school, I also had two small turtles.  I am not sure what kind they were, but I think
            they were baby red slider turtles.  This kind of turtle used to be sold in pet stores, but I think they have since 
            been banned...I believe because they carry salmonella.  I named my turtles Lucky and Buddy after some dogs that I read about
            in a book. Sadly, Lucky and Buddy met a very unfortunate death and were buried in matchbox car boxes in the 
            woods across the street.  We conducted a small funeral attended by only myself, my brother, and my two sisters.</p>

            <h2>Proudy</h2>    
            <img src=".\images\RhodeIslandRedChick.jpg" alt="Rhode Island Red Chick" height="360" width="445"></image> 
            <p class="petDesc">For Easter one year, my two sisters and I got baby chicks.  They were Rhode Island Red chickens.
            My chick walked around with its head held up high, so I named him Proudy.  Chico the dog liked following the 
            chicks around with his nose to the ground, following their trail. We kept them in a special set-up in the basement 
            (they got out to wander in the backyard and around the house under supervision). As they got bigger,
             my mom took them to a local feed store or somewhere like that to get them a more appropriate home. </p>

            <a name=gerbils></a>   
            <h2>Oscar and Ralph</h2>
            <img src=".\images\gerbils2.jpg" alt="gerbils" height="413" width="551"></image> 
            <p class="petDesc">During my grade school years, we also had two gerbils. They were named Oscar and Ralph. They
            enjoyed running in their HabiTrail wheel at night, shredding toilet paper rolls for bedding, and an occasional supervised 
            exploration around the house.  As he did with the chicks, Chico also loved to track the gerbils when we would 
            let them loose.</p>

            <section>
            <a name=daisy></a>   
            <h2>Daisy</h2>
            <img src=".\images\Daisy.jpg" alt="Daisy" height="507" width="330"></image> 
            <p class="petDesc">As an adult, I always wanted a dog, so a few months after I bought my house, I adopted a brittany mix puppy 
            and named her Daisy.  Daisy was a great dog and a perfect companion.  I won&#39;t say much more about Daisy, 
            or I would just go on and on about how wonderful she was.  I will just say that everyone that she met loved
            her and she once had an award-winning website of her own.

            <section>
            <a name=patches></a>   
            <h2>Patches</h2>
            <img src=".\images\Patches.jpg" alt="Patches" height="368" width="490"></image> 
            <p class="petDesc"> For many years, I fed three feral cats that hung out in the neighborhood. One day, a sickly calico
            cat showed up to eat with them. You could tell this calico had once had a home because she was very
            friendly to people. She hung around for several weeks before I decided that she would not be able to make
             it through winter outside.  So, I brought her in and adopted her and doctored her back to health. 
            I named her Patches.  I got lucky with Patches - she was more dog-like than cat-like...
            maybe it was because she was so sick, or maybe her previous owners trained her, but she does not jump up 
            on tables and kitchen counters and such.</p>

            <section>
            <a name="chance"></a>   
            <h2>Chance</h2>
            <img src=".\images\ChanceCropped.jpg" alt="Chance" height="400" width="400"></image> 
            <p class="petDesc">The most recent pet added to my family is Chance. I adopted him last year from 
            <a href="http://www.parkvilleshelter.com" target="_blank">Friends of Parkville Animal Shelter (FOPAS) </a> in order to keep
            Patches company and more active. I wasn&#39;t sure that the kitty was the right match for our little family 
            of Patches and me - when I took him home from the adoption, I felt like I was taking a chance.  So, I 
            eventually decided to name him Chance. He is a buff-colored American Shorthair. In his nature, Chance is a
            true cat and he has taught Patches some unbecoming cat behavior. Despite his antics, Chance has become a 
            beloved member of the family. 
             </p> 
            </section>

        <p>That is the summary of my life with pets thus far.  I have also fostered several dogs for FOPAS over the
            years.  Doing so has introduced me to the charms of some breeds that wouldn&#39;t normally be at the top of
            my list.  But each dog won me over and found good homes for themselves.  Now, with Patches and Chance, 
            it will be awhile before I add another permanent or foster pet to the family.
